This repository holds the design files for u-blox [XPLR-HPG-1](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-hpg-1) and [XPLR-HPG-2](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-hpg-2) hardware.



## [XPLR-HPG-1](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-hpg-1)
XPLR-HPG-1 High Precision GNSS evaluation platform allows developers to evaluate the different u-blox solutions around high precision GNSS. The modular design of the base board (C213) offers users great flexibility in to explore high precision GNSS with different topologies and hardware. The design is based on the u-blox [NORA-W106](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/nora-w10-series) that can act as a host and provides Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy v5.0 connectivity.
By using different u-blox module based MIKROE Click Boards, the user can evaluate different high precision GNSS topologies.



More info about the design can be found in the [XPLR-HPG-1 user guide](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-hpg-1)



## [XPLR-HPG-2](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-hpg-2)
XPLR-HPG-2 High Precision GNSS evaluation platform allows developers to evaluate the different u-blox solutions around high precision GNSS. In a simple form factor, XPLR-HPG-2 incorporates a high precision GNSS (u-blox [ZED-F9R](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/zed-f9r-module)), an LTE Cat-1 cellular modem (u-blox [LARA-R6001D](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/lara-r6-series)), a correction data L-BAND receiver (u-blox [NEO-D9S](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-d9s-series)) and a Wi-Fi capable host (u-blox [NINA-W106](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/nina-w10-series-open-cpu)) to orchestrate the High precision GNSS functionality.
